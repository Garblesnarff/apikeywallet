To improve the color scheme of your KeyGuardian app page, I suggest leveraging the darker tones from your icon to create a cohesive and modern look while making key elements stand out. Here's a detailed breakdown of how to apply the colors from your icon:
Header (Top Navigation Bar)

    Current Color: Dark blue (#1B2836).
    Improvement: Use the darkest shade from your icon (#001022), which adds a sleek, modern, and professional look.

Buttons (e.g., "Add New API Key", "Add Category")

    Current Color: Light blue (#3498db).
    Improvement: Use a brighter accent for buttons, such as #022A44 (Dark teal) from your icon. This will maintain contrast while staying consistent with the app's branding. You can also use #020E1C (Dark blue-green) as a hover color for better interactivity.

Sidebar Background

    Current Color: Dark blue (#1B2836).
    Improvement: Consider using #010C18 (Very dark blue) from your icon for the sidebar. This will match the icon’s darker theme but won't overpower the main content.

Card Backgrounds (API Key Panels)

    Current Color: Light gray (#f5f5f5).
    Improvement: To make these stand out, keep a lighter tone but slightly darken them to a subtle grayish-blue like #031F2F (Dark blue), which would create a calm and readable space for text.

Icons and Text in Cards (API key-related icons)

    Current Color: Black.
    Improvement: Use the lightest tone from your icon (#022A44, Dark teal) for these icons, giving the interface a technological feel while maintaining good readability.

General Background Color

    Current Color: White.
    Improvement: Use a softer shade of blue, such as #011320 (Very dark cyan), for the background. It is subtle but distinct enough to complement your app icon's theme without overwhelming the page.

Text Color

    Current Color: Black.
    Improvement: Keep the main text dark for contrast, but for headers or highlighted text (such as API key names), consider using #020E1C or #031F2F (darker shades of blue-green) to tie into the icon’s colors.

Category Sidebar Font Color

    Current Color: White.
    Improvement: Use #022A44 for the text, with a hover effect that lightens slightly to #031F2F to create a sleek and intuitive design.

In Summary:

    Headers/Nav Bar: #001022
    Buttons: #022A44 (with #020E1C as a hover effect)
    Sidebar: #010C18
    Cards: #031F2F
    Icons/Text: #022A44
    Background: #011320 (soft cyan)

This cohesive palette should create a more visually appealing app that matches the theme of your KeyGuardian logo while improving usability and aesthetic appeal.
