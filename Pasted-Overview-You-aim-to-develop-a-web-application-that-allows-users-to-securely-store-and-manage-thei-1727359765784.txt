Overview

You aim to develop a web application that allows users to securely store and manage their API keys. The application will feature email authentication, the ability to add new API keys, copy keys to the clipboard, and display keys in a masked format when viewed in the wallet.
Project Structure

    Technology Stack:
        Backend: Flask (Python web framework)
        Database ORM: SQLAlchemy
        Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for UI and clipboard functionality)
        Encryption Library: cryptography for secure storage of API keys

    Key Components:
        User authentication system (email and password)
        Secure API key storage with encryption
        User interface for adding and managing API keys
        Clipboard functionality for copying keys
        Security measures to protect user data and API keys

Implementation Plan
1. Project Setup

    Create Virtual Environment:
        Set up a Python virtual environment to manage dependencies.

    Install Dependencies:
        Flask
        SQLAlchemy
        Flask-Login (for session management)
        Flask-WTF (for form handling)
        Flask-Mail (if email confirmation is needed)
        cryptography (for encryption)
        Any other necessary libraries (e.g., python-dotenv for environment variables)

    Initialize Flask App:
        Create the main application file (app.py).
        Set up the application factory if needed.
        Configure the app with necessary settings (secret keys, database URI).

2. Database Design

    User Model:
    Field	Type	Constraints
    id	Integer	Primary Key
    email	String	Unique, Not Null
    password_hash	String	Not Null
    date_joined	DateTime	Defaults to now

    APIKey Model:
    Field	Type	Constraints
    id	Integer	Primary Key
    user_id	Integer	Foreign Key (User.id), Not Null
    key_name	String	Not Null
    encrypted_key	LargeBinary	Not Null
    date_added	DateTime	Defaults to now

    Relationships:
        Establish a one-to-many relationship between User and APIKey.

3. User Authentication System

    Registration:
        Form Fields: Email, Password, Confirm Password.
        Process:
            Validate form inputs.
            Check if the email already exists.
            Hash the password using generate_password_hash.
            Create a new User instance and save it to the database.
            Optionally, send a confirmation email using Flask-Mail.

    Login:
        Form Fields: Email, Password.
        Process:
            Validate form inputs.
            Retrieve the user by email.
            Verify the password using check_password_hash.
            Use login_user from Flask-Login to log the user in.

    Logout:
        Use logout_user from Flask-Login to log the user out.

    Session Management:
        Protect routes using @login_required.
        Configure session settings (e.g., session timeout).

4. Secure API Key Storage

    Encryption Key Management:
        Generate a symmetric encryption key using Fernet from the cryptography library.
        Store the encryption key in an environment variable (e.g., ENCRYPTION_KEY).
        Ensure the key is kept secret and not checked into version control.

    Encryption and Decryption Functions:
        Encryption (encrypt_key):
            Accepts the plain API key.
            Uses the encryption key to encrypt the API key.
            Returns the encrypted key (bytes).
        Decryption (decrypt_key):
            Accepts the encrypted API key.
            Uses the encryption key to decrypt it.
            Returns the plain API key.

    Storing API Keys:
        When a user adds a new API key:
            Encrypt the key using encrypt_key.
            Store the encrypted_key in the APIKey model.

5. User Interface and Templates

    Layout Template:
        Base HTML template with common elements (navigation bar, footer).

    Registration Page (/register):
        Form for new users to sign up.

    Login Page (/login):
        Form for existing users to log in.

    Wallet Page (/wallet):
        Displays a list of the user's API keys.
        Shows key_name and masked encrypted_key (e.g., ****).
        Includes "Add Key" and "Copy" buttons.

    Add Key Page (/add_key):
        Form for users to add a new API key.
        Fields: Key Name, API Key.

    JavaScript:
        Include scripts for handling the "Copy" button functionality using the Clipboard API.
        Use AJAX to securely fetch the decrypted API key when copying.

6. Routes and Views

    Authentication Routes:
        /register (GET/POST): Handles user registration.
        /login (GET/POST): Handles user login.
        /logout (GET): Logs the user out.

    API Key Management Routes:
        /wallet (GET): Displays the user's API keys.
        /add_key (GET/POST): Allows the user to add a new API key.
        /copy_key/<int:key_id> (POST): Endpoint to retrieve and copy the decrypted API key.

7. Implementing the "Add Key" Feature

    Form Validation:
        Ensure that both key_name and api_key are provided.
        Optionally, validate the format of the API key.

    Processing the Form:
        Encrypt the API key using encrypt_key.
        Create a new APIKey instance with the encrypted key.
        Associate it with the current user.
        Save it to the database.

8. Implementing the "Copy" Button

    Client-Side:
        Attach an event listener to the "Copy" button.
        When clicked, make an AJAX POST request to /copy_key/<key_id>.

    Server-Side Endpoint (/copy_key/<key_id>):
        Verify that the user is authenticated.
        Check that the key_id belongs to the current user.
        Decrypt the API key using decrypt_key.
        Return the plain API key in a JSON response.

    Copy to Clipboard:
        On receiving the response, use navigator.clipboard.writeText to copy the API key to the clipboard.
        Provide user feedback (e.g., a toast notification that the key was copied).

9. Displaying API Keys in the Wallet

    Masking the Keys:
        In the /wallet template, display the API keys as masked strings (e.g., ****).
        Only the key_name and date added are fully visible.

    Security Note:
        Never expose the plain API keys in the HTML source or templates.

10. Security Measures

    HTTPS:
        Ensure the application is served over HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.

    CSRF Protection:
        Use Flask-WTF's CSRF protection for all forms.
        For AJAX requests, include the CSRF token in the request headers.

    Session Security:
        Set SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE and SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY in the app configuration.
        Use strong secret keys for session management.

    Password Security:
        Use a strong hashing algorithm with salting (handled by generate_password_hash).

    Input Validation and Sanitization:
        Validate all user inputs on both client and server sides.
        Use parameterized queries (handled by SQLAlchemy) to prevent SQL injection.

    Access Control:
        Before decrypting and returning an API key, ensure that:
            The user is authenticated.
            The API key belongs to the user making the request.

    Rate Limiting:
        Implement rate limiting on sensitive endpoints to prevent abuse (e.g., using Flask-Limiter).

    Logging:
        Log important events (e.g., login attempts, failed logins, key additions).
        Ensure that logs do not contain sensitive information (e.g., API keys, passwords).

    Error Handling:
        Use custom error pages for 404, 500 errors.
        Avoid exposing stack traces or debug information in production.

11. Deployment Considerations

    Environment Configuration:
        Use environment variables for sensitive configurations (e.g., secret keys, database URIs).
        Create a .env file for development and configure the production environment accordingly.

    Database Migrations:
        Use Flask-Migrate to handle database schema changes.

    Static Files:
        Properly configure static file serving for CSS, JavaScript, and images.

    Scaling and Performance:
        Consider using a production-ready server (e.g., Gunicorn with Nginx).
        Optimize database queries and use indexing where appropriate.

12. Optional Features and Enhancements

    Email Confirmation:
        Send a confirmation email upon registration.
        Require users to confirm their email before accessing the wallet.

    Password Reset:
        Implement functionality for users to reset their passwords via email.

    Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):
        Add an extra layer of security for user authentication.

    API Key Expiration and Revocation:
        Allow users to set expiration dates for their API keys.
        Provide functionality to revoke or delete API keys.

    Audit Trail:
        Keep a log of actions performed on API keys (e.g., when a key was added, copied).

    User Profile Management:
        Allow users to update their profile information and change their password.

    Responsive Design:
        Ensure the application is mobile-friendly.

    Internationalization (i18n):
        Support multiple languages if targeting a global audience.

Workflow Summary

    User Registration and Login:
        Users create an account using their email and a password.
        Users log in to access their API key wallet.

    Adding an API Key:
        Users navigate to the "Add Key" page.
        Users enter a key name and the API key.
        The API key is encrypted and stored securely in the database.

    Viewing the Wallet:
        Users see a list of their API keys, with key names and masked keys.
        Users can add new keys or copy existing ones.

    Copying an API Key:
        Users click the "Copy" button next to an API key.
        An AJAX request is sent to retrieve the decrypted key.
        The key is copied to the user's clipboard.

Security Best Practices

    Protect Sensitive Data:
        Never log or display plain API keys or passwords.
        Ensure that encryption keys are securely managed.

    Keep Dependencies Updated:
        Regularly update third-party libraries to patch security vulnerabilities.

    Perform Security Testing:
        Conduct penetration testing and code reviews.
        Use tools to scan for common security issues.

    Backup and Recovery:
        Implement a backup strategy for the database.
        Ensure backups are encrypted and tested for integrity.

Final Notes

By following this detailed plan, you will create a secure and user-friendly API key wallet application. The key focus areas are secure storage of API keys, user authentication, and a seamless user experience for managing and using API keys.

Remember to prioritize security at every step, from encryption to session management, and keep user data protected both in transit and at rest. Regularly update your security practices based on the latest guidelines and ensure compliance with any relevant regulations.
