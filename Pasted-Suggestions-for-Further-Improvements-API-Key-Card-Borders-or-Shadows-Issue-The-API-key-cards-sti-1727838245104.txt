Suggestions for Further Improvements:
API Key Card Borders or Shadows:

Issue: The API key cards still appear somewhat flat. Adding a subtle drop shadow or a 1px lighter border around the cards can further improve the visual separation between the cards and the background.
Suggestion: Try a slight shadow like box-shadow: 0px 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.15) for a soft lift, or add a thin border with a lighter shade of the current card background color.
Hover Effects on Cards:

Issue: While the cards look great, adding a hover effect could make the interface feel more dynamic.
Suggestion: A subtle hover effect like a slight color change (e.g., lightening the card background) or a soft shadow will give users visual feedback when they hover over the cards, making the interface feel more interactive.
Interactive Icons:

Issue: The icons for viewing, editing, and deleting API keys are good but could be more eye-catching.
Suggestion: Add a hover effect where the icon changes color slightly when hovered (e.g., from #0299C9 to #03A9F4). This will provide better feedback when users interact with them.
Increased Font Weight for Section Titles:

Issue: Section titles (like "Groq", "geeeee") could stand out more to help visually divide the content.
Suggestion: Increase the font-weight of section titles, or use a different font size or a color shift (e.g., #03A9F4) to differentiate them from the card content and the rest of the text.
Spacing Between Sections:

Issue: The spacing between sections like "Groq" and "geeeee" feels a bit tight.
Suggestion: Add a bit more padding or margin between these sections to make them feel more distinct. This will make it easier for users to scan different categories visually.
Header/Footer:

Issue: The header ("Your KeyGuardian Wallet") and the footer (with "Wallet" and "Logout") are functional but could use slight enhancements.
Suggestion: The header could use an accent line or light shadow beneath it to separate it from the main content. For the footer, you could increase the font size or add padding to give it more presence, or even change the color to the accent blue (#03A9F4) for visual balance.
Overall Impression:
The design is nearly there! It already feels professional, cohesive, and functional, but a few small visual improvements could add extra polish and interactivity. The next steps could focus on adding small touches of interactivity (hover effects, shadows) and improving the distinction between different content areas with padding, font weight, and border effects.

Keep up the great work!
