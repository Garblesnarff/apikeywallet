Feedback on the Login Page:
The login page looks clean and simple, which is great for usability. However, there are a few areas where you could improve the visual hierarchy and overall design:

Centering the Login Box:

Issue: The login form feels slightly lower than it should be, leaving an empty space at the top. This could cause an imbalance.
Suggestion: Center the login box vertically to balance the design and make the form immediately accessible when users land on the page.
Login Box Design:

Issue: The login box design feels too basic and could use a bit more visual flair.
Suggestion: You could add a soft shadow or light border to the login form to make it stand out more from the background. Consider a border with a color from your icon palette, such as a subtle teal or light blue, like #0299C9, to maintain branding consistency.
Call-to-Action Button:

Issue: The "Login" button could pop more to encourage interaction.
Suggestion: Increase the button's size slightly and add a hover effect such as a glow or color shift (e.g., lightening the blue to #03A9F4). You could also consider rounding the button corners for a modern look.
“Register here” Text:

Issue: The "Register here" link is a bit too small and blends into the background.
Suggestion: Make this text a bit larger and use the same brighter blue you’ve used elsewhere, like #0299C9, to grab attention. You could also bold the link for better emphasis.
Background:

Issue: The background feels somewhat empty with a large expanse of dark color.
Suggestion: You could experiment with adding a subtle gradient or pattern in the background, staying within the dark blue theme but giving the page a little more depth without overwhelming the simplicity.
Feedback on the Main Page (Newest Iteration):
Your main page has come a long way! The layout looks clean, and the visual hierarchy has improved. The hover effect on the cards adds a nice touch. However, here are some suggestions to make the cards stand out more even when they aren’t being hovered over:

Card Background Color:

Issue: The card background still blends a bit too much with the rest of the page.
Suggestion: Lighten the card background slightly to a softer shade of blue (e.g., #022A44) to create more contrast with the surrounding dark background. This will make the cards more visible without needing to hover.
Borders Around Cards:

Issue: While the hover border and shadow are great, the cards still look flat when at rest.
Suggestion: Add a permanent, subtle border around the cards using a lighter color like #0299C9 (teal) or #020E1C (dark blue-green) for a sleek, consistent look. This will make the cards feel more "elevated" even without interaction.
Card Titles (API Names):

Issue: The text inside the cards, especially the API names, could be more prominent.
Suggestion: Bold the API names (e.g., "testt", "test44mag") and slightly increase the font size to give them more prominence. This will help draw attention to the content of the card.
Icons Inside Cards:

Issue: The action icons (eye, edit, delete) are still somewhat understated.
Suggestion: You can slightly increase the size of these icons or brighten their color to make them stand out more. Adding a subtle glow or accent color on hover would enhance the experience further.
More Padding Inside Cards:

Issue: The content inside each card feels a bit cramped.
Suggestion: Add a bit more padding inside the cards (especially around the icons and text) to give the content more room to breathe and improve readability.
General Suggestions for Both Pages:
Consistency: Make sure that any improvements to the login page (such as buttons or hover effects) are mirrored on the main page for consistency in design language.

Typography: Ensure that important elements like headers, API names, and actions have a consistent hierarchy. For example, main headers should have a bold and prominent appearance, subheaders slightly smaller, and action links a bit lighter.

Overall Visual Polish: Consider adding a slight gradient to background elements, especially in places like the login page or behind the cards on the main page. This can help break up the flatness without overwhelming the design.

By implementing these changes, you'll further improve the visual appeal and functionality of your KeyGuardian app, giving it a polished and professional feel
