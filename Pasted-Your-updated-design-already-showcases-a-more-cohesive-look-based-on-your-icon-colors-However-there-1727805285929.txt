Your updated design already showcases a more cohesive look based on your icon colors. However, there are a few areas where the contrast and readability could be improved for a more user-friendly experience:
1. Text Readability

    Issue: The sidebar and text on buttons seem a bit too dark against the deep background, making them harder to read.
    Suggestion: Lighten the text in the sidebar, such as using a shade like #E0E0E0 (light gray) for the text. This will improve readability while keeping the contrast.
    The button text could be brighter as well, switching to something like #F0F0F0 to ensure readability without clashing with the design.

2. Buttons and Interactive Elements

    Issue: The buttons blend into the background because their color is too similar to the card background.
    Suggestion: For the "Add New API Key" button and other interactive elements, you can try a brighter shade of teal like #0299C9 to make them pop more. You can also add a hover effect (like a slight glow) using #03A9F4 to indicate interactivity.

3. Card Borders

    Issue: The API key cards look slightly "flat" and blend into the background.
    Suggestion: Add a subtle border around each card, using a lighter blue like #022A44 for the border color. Alternatively, a soft shadow effect (like box-shadow in CSS) can help the cards stand out from the background.

4. Contrast Between Background Sections

    Issue: The background for the API key cards is dark, which matches the page's main background, making it hard to visually separate sections.
    Suggestion: Lighten the card background slightly to #031F2F, which is still dark but creates better separation. This will visually distinguish the content from the rest of the page without breaking the aesthetic.

5. Highlight Important Elements

    Issue: The eye icon for viewing keys and the other action icons (edit, delete) are not standing out enough.
    Suggestion: Use the lighter accent teal (such as #0299C9) for these icons to grab attention. When hovered over, they can turn a brighter shade like #03A9F4.

6. Sidebar Background

    Issue: The sidebar and the main content area blend into each other because of similar dark tones.
    Suggestion: Lighten the sidebar slightly to #010F1D to differentiate it more from the rest of the page. This gives a structured and organized feel to the layout.

7. Hover Effects

    Issue: Some elements like the sidebar links and buttons would benefit from a hover effect to signal interactivity.
    Suggestion: Add a hover effect for sidebar items where the background color subtly shifts to #022A44, and the text lightens to #F0F0F0. For buttons, a slightly lighter version of the current blue when hovered would work.

8. Font Size and Weight

    Issue: The header and section titles (like "Groq") could be more prominent to add structure to the page.
    Suggestion: Increase the font size slightly for headers and make them bold or use a semi-bold weight to help divide sections more clearly.

By making these small adjustments, you should be able to further improve the readability, usability, and overall visual appeal of your KeyGuardian app interface.
